            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                It all started with a swipe...
            </p>
            <p>
                Kevin and Melissa met on the dating app Tinder in 2015. Melissa maintains that Kevin's Corgi Link was the deciding factor that caused her to swipe right.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their first date was at Corner Social in Harlem, NYC (Melissa was early, Kevin was late). They immediately found many things to talk about, from their mutual move for the arts (musicals) to their favorite Rom-Coms (The Holiday). And date #2 was set in no time.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was during Date #2 that Kevin was introduced to Melissa's love for food, and more specifically: Hatch green chile.
            </p>

            <p>
                One weekend, while Melissa was out of town at a Bachelorette party, Kevin secretly flew to Colorado to ask for her family's blessing to propose to Melissa. Everyone agreed and Kevin was headed back to NYC, all in 24 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once a ring had been procured, Kevin invited Melissa's family and his parents to witness the proposal.

                    <h3>Elizabeth Stauffer</h3>
                    <h4>Matron of Honor</h4>
                    <p>Elizabeth and Melissa met their Freshman year at the University of Denver and instantly bonded over their love of Harry Potter, travel, music, and, most importantly, Nutella. They've been friends for over 14 years (!!) and have had too many adventures to count. She's one of the most creative and genuine people Melissa has ever met.</p>
                    <p>Fun fact: Elizabeth and Melissa spent a semester abroad in Milan, Italy, and every Friday morning would go to a cafe on their street and get chocolate filled croissants and cappuccino. They became known as "Le sorelle" (the Sisters) to the staff there!</p>

                    <h4>Maid of Honor</h4>
                    <p>Lauren and Melissa have been inseparable since they first met in Graduate school at NYU! They've seen countless shows together (some good, some not so good), survived two New York apartments, and travelled around Europe. Lauren makes sure Melissa has seen the best TV shows and movies from the 90's and always keeps Melissa's sweet tooth satisfied with her amazing baked goods!</p>
                    <p>Fun fact: Lauren and Melissa can sing the entire West Wing theme song. Yes, the instrumental one. And it's beautiful.</p>

                    <h3>Bridget Kelly</h3>
                    <h4>Bridesmaid</h4>
                    <p>Bridget and Melissa met in NYC almost ten years ago and she is Melissa's most texted friend probably ever. From dishing on their favorite reality TV shows to getting advice about something going on in life, Melissa texts Bridget for just about everything. She makes Melissa laugh harder than anyone else and also speaks faster than anyone else!</p>
                    <p>Fun fact: Bridget and Melissa entered the lottery for Hamilton on Broadway a buuuuunch (like seriously, a bunch) of times and Bridget won and took Melissa with her to the show! They were front row smiling ear-to-ear the entire time and now have this bragging right for life!</p>

                    <h4>Bridesman</h4>
                    <p>Zac was one of Melissa's very first friends in New York! They worked together in the Special Events office at NYU and would leave each other sticky notes and candy between shifts. They've since seen each other go through lots of life changes and special moments!</p>
                    <p>Fun fact: Zac has a freakishly great memory. He often reminds and corrects Melissa of dates, and will also tell her what they were both wearing and/or doing on that specific day.</p>

                    <h4>Bridesmaid</h4>
                    <p>Kathleen is a ball of energy who brings the life to any party. Or class. Or dinner... Pretty much anywhere! Kathleen is one of the friends who you go out with for a quick drink and five hours later you're still talking! Kathleen and Melissa met in Grad school at NYU and now both live in Astoria where they've found many a wine bar at which to have hours-long chats!</p>
                    <p>Fun fact: One of their favorite and longest traditions is watching The Bachelor/Bachelorette together! It always involves eating massive amounts of food.</p>

                    <h4>Bridesmaid</h4>
                    <p>It's important for everyone to know that Melissa was friends with her sister-in-law Kristin BEFORE her brother. So take that, Chris! Kristin and Melissa met in, where else, band at Douglas County High School! She's always been a great person to go to for advice and is adventurous and cares so much about family.</p>
                    <p>Fun fact: Kristin and Melissa went to a haunted corn maze once where they encountered a man with a chainsaw. Neither their fight nor flight responses kicked in and they clung to each other and curled up on the ground until someone on the staff came and told chainsaw man to leave them alone. He is not invited to the wedding.</p>

                    <p>Fun fact: Pranks played on young Sarah include, but are not limited to: telling her constantly that she was adopted and convincing her that deer are hatched out of hay bales.</p>

                    <p>Fun fact: Jonny and Kevin are terrible at texting one another, one time leading to Kevin waiting for Jonny all night on a stoop with a 6-pack of Sam Adams Summer Ale.</p>

                    <p>Nick and Kevin are friends from college (SU) and beyond and 100% of the scary movies they have seen together have been against Kevin's will. Except for The Mummy. Kevin has never met a bigger fan of The Mummy.</p>
                    <p>Fun fact: Kevin has learned about most of the best music ever made from Nick and his thorough Spotify playlists. Phil Collins: check. Linda Ronstadt: check. Doobie Brothers: double check.</p>

                    <p>Fun fact: One time Jeremy and Kevin drove to DC to see an opera. Halfway there, Kevin pulled the tickets out of his pocket and jokingly exclaimed, "These tickets are for <i>last</i> night!" But they actually <i>were</i> for last night. They turned around and went home very disappointed.</p>

                    <p>Fun fact: Nolan and Kevin have been working on the same app for at least 3 years now, but like true art, will it ever <i>really</i> be finished? Hopefully yes.</p>
